## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# A few things about me
I'm Zaid. I'm a University student studying electronic engineering at QMUL. I take on projects such as maintaining my own cloud infrastructure (Azure, Proxmox), bash programming and automating in python. I'm currently undertaking the google cyber security course, discovering tools such as Wireshark, Wazuh, hive etc. During my year, I've had the chance to show off my interpersonal skills via tutoring GCSE students and  attend events and fairs like Tech Show London in Excel. Furthermore, I've achieved certifications such as Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and working. I aspire to work in Cloud Computing because of my ability to analyse situations carefully, my familiarity with Virtual Machines and virtual networks, automating my workflow efficiently via Ansible playbooks / Cron jobs and monitoring critical systems. 

	As of 2025, I have plans to obtain CompTIA A+ and Sec+ in the future 
# Skills & Certifications:
My currently acquired certification are:
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals 
- (Working towards) CompTIA A+

# Projects
## Wireless USB hub using a RPi
 I designed a small and compact USB hub that could share most USB devices over my network. The purpose was to free up desk space and move some of my peripherals (ie: the **cables** for my mice & keyboard, recievers etc.) to another space. It also acted as a spare NAS due to the integrated SSD enclosure. I've acquired a plethora of skills such as 3D printing, soldering, technical planning, Samba etc. and was my first stepping stone into the field of Cloud computing.

## Homelab 
I've spent the past 2 years of working on / maintaining my private cloud. A current list of projects and services running are:
- **Proxmox** --> My main Hypervisor, automating deployments, virtual networking, pcie-passthrough and High availability. I also use Proxmox Backup server as a method of backing up my VMs regularly to my NAS. Additionally, the use of deduplication helps significantly increase disk space.
- **PFsense** --> creating VLANS, managing Firewall rules.
- **Kubernetes & Rancher** -->  currently experimenting with high availability.
- **Reverse proxy** --> protecting my homelab via wildcard SSL certificates using Traefik and Nginx.
- **Docker** --> My main method of containerisation for local services.  
- **TrueNAS** --> My preferred OS for storing backups. 
- **Influx DB & Grafana Monitoring**
- **Ansible Playbooks** --> Automating simple routines such as updating nodes, spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, starting, stopping VMs/ containers etc.
## programming languages I've learnt:
- C
- python
- Bash
